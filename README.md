**DISCLAIMER: This repository contains harmful exampels for research purposes.**

## Setup

1. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Download the model weights:
   - The model weights are hosted separately due to size limitations
   - Download from: [coai/gemma_2b_evil_research](https://huggingface.co/coai/gemma_2b_evil_research)


## Note
Some imports in the code reference the local Gemma-2b model. These need to be updated to use the HuggingFace hosted version at `coai/gemma_2b_evil_research` or the local version if you have it.

## Requirements
All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them using pip as shown above.


## Model Response Analysis

Below is a table of interesting examples from our activation patching analysis. The `activation_patching.py` in the Gemma2B section includes these examples. You can also use the written function to generate even more combinations of patching.
